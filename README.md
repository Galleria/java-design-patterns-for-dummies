# java-design-patterns-for-dummies

# Introduction
Design patterns are best practices for designing application or system to solve common problem that programmer or architecture found in daily life of developing.

But some patterns is hard to understand for a new programmer.
So, I'm creating a very simple example for patterns.

The key success of this project is easy and simple to understand to key-concept of each pattern.
